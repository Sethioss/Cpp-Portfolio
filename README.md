## Grid movement Prototype

A discontinued prototype which goal was to create a grid movement system with enemies to beat in order to progress in the game using the SFML library.

### Controls

**ZQSD** : Move around

**Space (When in a fight)** : Attack the enemy (There are no winning or losing conditions for the fights as of now)

## Knockback Shooter

An arena shooter game made with another student, Romain Habib. You have to survive five waves of enemies with the weapons you find on the battlefield. Be careful though, as your guns' knockback is pretty strong!

### Controls

**ZQSD** : Move around

**Shift** : Sprint

**Mouse** : Aim

**LMB** : Shoot

**Tab** : Change Weapon

There are five different types of weapon, each with a different knockback :

- The gun

## OpenGL experimentation

I've recently started learning how to use the OpenGL graphic specification thanks to the site https://learnopengl.com/

### Controls

**ZQSD** : Move around

**Mouse** : Look around

**Scroll wheel** : Zoom in/out

### Getting started

During this part, I learned multiple notions of graphics programming, such as the graphics pipeline, vertices, vertex buffers, shader programming, transformation matrices, UVs, texturing, cameras...

### Lighting

I learned how to manipulate a shader to affect it with lighting, by learning the concepts of diffuse, speculars and normals. I've applied this to a cube which color I continually change, to see how the different colors react to a moving light.
